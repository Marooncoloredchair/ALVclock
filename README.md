## Description

At my school, in (almost) every room, there is a TV. On that TV is a clock + schedule that is a website that is run over the closed-circuit cable system. The last version was created in 2003 by a guy who is now a rocket scientist. This is our attempt at a new version of it.

### To-Do

* Password-protect administration.
* Better administration styling.
