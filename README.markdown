## What is it?

The Farmington High School Clock is displayed on a television in each classroom. It displays the time and date, periods (and current period) of the day, marquee items, and notices for the school.

## How does it work?

It runs on [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) (via [MongoMapper](http://mongomapper.com)). Views (templates) are written in [Haml](http://haml-lang.com). Tests are written in [RSpec](http://rspec.info). The production server is [Phusion Passenger (standalone)](http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Standalone.html). Continuous integration by [CIJoe](https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe) (because knowing is half the battle).
