## What is it?

The Farmington High School Clock is displayed on a television in each classroom. It displays the time and date, periods (and current period) of the day, marquee items, and notices for the school.

## Can I use it for my school?

Sure! I would [contact me](mailto:ethan.turkeltaub.com) about the production environment, modifying the code for your school, and deployment.
